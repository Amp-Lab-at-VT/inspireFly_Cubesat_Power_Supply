## Current Status
Just Starting

## Project Overview
This project is one of many involved in creating a inspireFly's 1U cube-sat. This specific page is dedicated to the creation of
the power system that will be used to power the cube-sat on its mission. 
## Educational Value Added
This project will teach students about advanced power systems concepts, such as DC-DC converters, how to charge batteries, and how electronics in space work.
Additionally students will learn how to create circuit schematics and PCB board designs that are used to manufacture a product.

## Tasks
1. Choose an open source design to start from
2. Replace any out of stock components in the design with equivalent in stock components
3. Modify the design to fit our specific mission needs

## Design Decisions
Decided to base our power system primarily off of FloripaSat-1's power system

## Design Misc

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

## BOM + Component Cost
To be determined
## Timeline
11/15/2022: Have power information known for other boards involved in the overall project
11/22/2022: Have schematic drawn
11/30/2022: Have PCB board layout done
